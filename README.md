## Hi there, I'm Andrey Perepechin - aka Meizer 👋

I work as a technical manager for large businesses, integrate special payment systems, and provide support for solving banking issues in companies. Analytical tasks have appeared in my work, and I plan to continue my career in this area. Experience in working with customers, programming and data analysis skills, as well as experience in organizing work between different departments will help with this.

🔭 I’m currently working at  **T-Bank**

⚙️ I use technologies and tools:\
    - Python 3.0 (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scipy, seaborn, plotly, sqlalchemy, sklearn)\
    - PostgreSQL\
    - A/B-tests\
    - Jupyter Notebook\
    - Excel\
    - Tableau\
    - ICE, RICE frameworks
